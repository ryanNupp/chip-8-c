# chip-8-c
A chip 8 emulator written in C 

I gave up on this project and opted to rewrite a lot of the stuff with C++

That can be found here: https://github.com/ryanNupp/chip-8-cpp

In the rewrite I also decided to use SDL3 for graphics and creating a display window.
In this version I used ncurses in the terminal for the display, which worked okay except for input.
